A GUI for processing the raw output from Aviv CDs and fluorimeters and generating pretty, annotated text output.  It takes the raw instrument output and detects the experiment type, bringing up a window for processing each variety of experiment.  It currently handles temperature melts, chemical denaturation experiments, pH denaturation experiments, and wavelength scans (CD only).

The program is cross-platform and only requires that Python 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6 is installed.
